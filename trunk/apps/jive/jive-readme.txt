Jive
Plugin host, sequencer & modular environment for live electronic jamming

Heavily based on Juced project:
http://code.google.com/p/juced/

and in turn on Juce:
http://rawmaterialsoftware.com/juce.php

Without the above this project would be nowhere near possible.

At present this is a direct fork of Jost from the Juced project. I have made various changes to suit my personal needs. In time these changes may be rolled into another project, or this project my take on a life of its own - for now this repository and project enables me to work effectively on my own branch of the Juced code. I saw huge potential in the Jost application and wanted to start promoting and documenting the project; leading to this fork of the original project. I would like to stress that only small parts of this project are my own work, the project is heavily indebted to Juced and Juce.
